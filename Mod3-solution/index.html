            <h3>Aloo Gobi</h3>
        <p title="Aloo Gobi">The only difference being there are onions in this one and it is slightly more spiced than a makhani gravy. The makhani gravy is made mainly with tomatoes and cashews.

        In this recipe along with cashew paste I have even added butter and cream. You can skip the butter and cream if you donâ€™t want them as the cashews and tomatoes already make the gravy creamy.

        Addition of kasuri methi (dry fenugreek leaves) gives a nice final touch to the recipe. You can consider making this creamy aloo gobi masala for special or festive occasions, guests or parties. Overall this recipe is delicious and is a keeper.

        This recipe can also be made with paneer or tofu. </p></div>

            <h3>Chana Masala</h3>
        <p title="Chana Masala">Chana Masala needs no introduction. It is one of the most popular Indian dishes, whether its in India or in the western world.

        In Delhi though, we usually make Chole, which is very similar to Chana Masala but uses a special blend of spices.

        Both are made with white chickpeas but chana masala is made using basic everyday Indian spices.

        Punjabi style chole is also usually darker in color and simmered for much longer time.

        However, my mom made this simple Chana Masala often with poori or paratha and we relished every bit of it.

        The dish uses everyday Indian spices like coriander powder, cumin powder, paprika, turmeric and garam masala.

        <p id="col3" title="Butter Paneer">This Paneer Butter Masala recipe is a rich and creamy dish of paneer (cottage cheese) in a tomato, butter and cashew sauce (known as Makhani gravy).

        The dish has a lovely tang coming from the tomatoes and is slightly sweet with a creamy and velvety feel to it.

        Called by various names such as butter paneer or butter paneer masala or paneer makhani this dish is of the most popular Indian paneer dish. Obviously being so popular it is served in many Indian restaurants.
